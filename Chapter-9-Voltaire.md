# Chapter 9: Voltaire

*‘No problem can withstand the assault of sustained thinking’* ― Voltaire

## Money is social
With a few noteworthy exceptions most blockchains have made no provision for future upgrades. The capacity to effectively drive a soft or hard fork is critical to a cryptocurrency’s long-term viability. As a result, investors are unlikely to spend millions of dollars on protocols whose roadmap and participants are fleeting, petty, or extremist. There must be an efficient procedure for forming agreement on a vision for the underlying protocol’s evolution. Fragmentation might split the group apart if this process is difficult.

Cryptocurrencies are an excellent illustration of money’s social component. When comparing Bitcoin, Litecoin and Dogecoin merely on the basis of technology, there is little difference between the three. Despite this, both Litecoin and Dogecoin have relatively large market capitalizations, active communities, and their own social agendas.

It might be claimed that a significant portion of a cryptocurrency’s worth is generated from its community, how they use their funds, and how involved they are in the currency’s progress. Adding to the idea, other currencies, such as Dash,[^01] Tezos[^02] and Polkdot[^03] have built methods directly into the protocol to allow its users to vote on what should be prioritized for development and funding.

The huge variety of cryptocurrencies also demonstrates their social aspects. Fragmentation and forks result from disagreements over philosophy, monetary policy, or even petty squabbling amongst the core developers. CH at ScotFest 2022:

> People fall out over values, not facts

Unlike their digital cousins, fiat currencies tend to weather political upheavals and local disputes without a currency crisis. It seems that certain aspects of legacy systems are absent from the crypto sector. Cardano’s stance is that protocol users need incentives to understand the social contract that underpins their system and the opportunity to suggest modifications in a constructive manner. This independence applies to every facet of a value exchange system, from market regulation to project funding. However, it cannot be mediated by central actors, nor does it need any credential that may be co-opted by a privileged few.

Funding invariably dries up, regardless of the success of a crowdsale[^04] to bootstrap development. As a result, Cardano contains a treasury that reduces inflation and transaction fees over time. Through a ballot mechanism, any user should be able to seek funds from the trust, and stakeholders should vote on who becomes a beneficiary. By creating a discussion about who should be financed, the process produces a positive feedback loop like those found in other cryptocurrencies with governance systems, such as Dash. Healthy dialogue ensures that the community is always assessing and arguing its views ahead of crucial decisions.

Long running and, in many instances, unresolved disagreements about the technical and moral direction of the codebase have plagued Bitcoin with its block size debate, Ethereum with the DAO split, and a slew of other cryptocurrencies. Many of these conflicts, as well as the splitting of the community that occurs when action is taken, can be attributed to the absence of any mechanism for implementing change.

Looking to lessons from the past, Bitcoin’s adoption of (SegWit) Segregated Witness[^05] could have been handled a lot better.[^06] Did the DAO attack[^07] really have to result in the hard fork on Ethereum? Could it have been managed better so there was not such a dramatic community breakdown?[^08]

In the worst-case scenario, moral authority to act might simply devolve to whomever has the developers, infrastructure links, and money, rather than the community’s best interests. It’s difficult to gauge if actions are valid if a major segment of the community is unavailable, or disengaged owing to poor incentives.[^09]

Some cryptocurrencies like Tezos have a model where the cryptocurrency protocol is handled as a constitution, with three parts (Transaction, Consensus, and Network) and a set of explicit rules and procedures for updating the constitution. However, there is still a lot of work to be done on incentives and how to represent and update a crypto protocol using a formal language.

IOG have been researching governance in crypto for years. They have written papers as far back as 2017 on proposing a treasury for Ethereum Classic.[^10] Another paper, authored out of Lancaster University,[^11] focused on the concept of a treasury system and a viable, democratic method to long-term development financing for Cardano.

Formal methods, machine comprehensible specifications, and combining a treasury with this process for financial incentives are just some of the solutions IOG pursued. Looking back now, it’s clear they were putting the chess pieces in place, to create the apparatus necessary for the *Age of Voltaire* vision presented at ScotFest[^12] in November 2022. More on this later.

[^01]: **Dash** is an open source cryptocurrency and is a form of decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) run by a subset of users, called ‘masternodes’. It is an altcoin that was forked from the Bitcoin protocol. The currency permits fast transactions that can be untraceable.
[^02]: **Tezos** (ticker: XTZ) is a decentralized blockchain founded by Arthur Breitman and Kathleen Breitman. The Breitmans also founded Dynamic Ledger Solutions (DLS), a company primarily focused on developing Tezos technology and owns the Tezos Intellectual property. The currency was launched in an initial coin offering (ICO) on July 1, 2017.

[^04]: **Crowdsales** are a popular use for Ethereum; they let you allocate tokens to network participants in various ways, mostly in exchange for Ether. They come in a variety of shapes and flavors.
[^05]: Segregated Witness, or SegWit, is the name used for an implemented soft fork change in the transaction format of bitcoin.

[^09]: Incentive: a method of encouraging members to participate in the network by providing them with a return proportionate to their efforts.  By promoting persistent, active, and robust engagement, incentives strive to maintain equality and fairness in a dispersed network of participants. The incentives necessary in Cardano’s incentives model are calculated using game theory.
