# Chapter 3: Proof of Stake

*‘He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how’* ― Friedrich Nietzsche




[^1]: In a **synchronous system**, operations are coordinated by one, or more, centralized clock signals. An asynchronous digital system, in contrast, has no global clock. Asynchronous systems do not depend on strict arrival times of signals or messages for reliable operation. Coordination is achieved via events such as: packet arrival, changes (transitions) of signals, handshake protocols, and other methods.

Taking inspiration from the 1980s BBC Computer Literacy Project, the single-board computer running Linux with open-source software was launched in 2012 costing £22 to encourage computing in schools and the developing world.

[^5]: A **light client** is a lightweight computer that has been optimized for establishing a remote connection with a server-based computing environment. The server does most of the work, which can include launching software programs, performing calculations, and storing data. This contrasts with a fat client or a conventional personal computer; the former is also intended for working in a client–server model but has significant local processing power, while the latter aims to perform its function mostly locally.

[^22]: **Oligarchy**, meaning ‘few’, and ‘to rule or to command’, is a form of power structure in which power rests with a small number of people.
[^23]: A **51% attack** is a hostile takeover of a Cryptocurrency validated via proof-of-work Algorithms through the acquisition of the majority of the network's hashing power.
[^24]: In a **Sybil attack**, the attacker subverts the reputation system of a peer-to-peer network by creating a large number of pseudonymous identities and uses them to gain a disproportionately large influence. It is named after the subject of the book Sybil, a case study of a woman diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder.
[^25]: **Pledging**: when a stake pool operator assigns their own ada stake to support their stake pool. This provides protection against Sybil attacks by preventing pool owners from creating a large number of pools without themselves owning a lot of stake.
[^26]: **Liquid staking** allows users to stake their funds while actively participating in securing proof-of-stake blockchains. You can still access your funds, or use it to participate in other DeFi protocols. Your fund, ada, is never locked or ‘bonded’.

[^28]:  **Slashing** is a mechanism used by PoS protocols to discourage harmful behaviors and make validators more responsible. They help keep the network secure since, without slashing penalties, a validator can use the same node to validate blocks on multiple chains or do so on the wrong chain.
[^29]:  **Nash equilibrium** is used in game theory for modeling and defining the solution in a game where players do not cooperate together.
[^30]: **Profit margin**: The stake pool operator takes a portion of total ada rewards before dividing the remainder of the rewards with all of the pool’s delegators. If the operator’s profit margin is low, they’re taking less risks, which means delegators should anticipate reaping more of the rewards for their delegated stake. A private pool is one with a profit margin of 100%, indicating that the operator receives all of the rewards and the delegators get none.
[^31]: **cost per epoch**: The stake pool operator deducts a predetermined charge from the pool payouts every epoch to cover the expenses of maintaining a stake pool. Before the operator collects their profit margin, the cost per epoch is removed from the total ada that is awarded to a pool. Whatever is left is divided evenly among the delegators.
[^32]: **Multisignature** (multi-signature) is a digital signature scheme which allows a group of users to sign a single document. Usually, a multisignature algorithm produces a joint signature that is more compact than a collection of distinct signatures from all users. Multisignature can be considered as generalization of both group and ring signatures providing additional security for cryptocurrency transactions.

[^35]: **Peer-to-peer (P2P)**: distributed application architecture that partitions tasks or workloads between peers. Peers are equally privileged, equipotent participants in the application. They are said to form a peer-to-peer network of nodes. In Cardano this involves sending transactions (or files) directly between nodes in a decentralized system without relying on a centralized authority.

[^37]: **Key pair**: Public-key cryptography, or asymmetric cryptography, is a cryptographic system that uses pairs of keys: public keys which may be disseminated widely, and private keys which are known only to the owner. The generation of such keys depends on cryptographic algorithms based on mathematical problems to produce one-way functions. Effective security only requires keeping the private key private; the public key can be openly distributed without compromising security. Within the blockchain, these keys are used to process and authorize transactions.

[^41]: **Saturation**: a word that refers to a stake pool that has more stake delegated to it than is optimal for the network. The saturation level is expressed as a percentage. When a stake pool achieves 100% saturation, the rewards start to shrink. The saturation mechanism was created to avoid centralization by encouraging delegators to delegate to multiple stake pools and operators to build up alternative pools in order to keep receiving maximum rewards. Saturation aims to safeguard both the interests of ada holders delegating their stake and the interests of stake pool operators.

[^43]: In general, **bootstrapping** usually refers to a self-starting process that is supposed to proceed without external input. In computer technology the term (usually shortened to booting) usually refers to the process of loading the basic software into the memory of a computer after power-on or general reset, especially the operating system which will then take care of loading other software as needed.
[^44]:  An **unspent transaction output (UTXO)** is the technical term for the amount of digital currency that remains after a cryptocurrency transaction.

[^47]: **Rewards Wallet**: a wallet that contains ada and may be used to delegate stakes. A stake may only be delegated to a single stake pool from a single Rewards wallet. You’ll need to construct numerous Rewards wallets and divide ada across them if you want to delegate to more than one stake pool. Split pool delegation has been promised by IOG for some time but has been postponed, to allow focusing resources on other roadmap priorities.
[^48]: **Balance wallet**: your original testnet ada balance, copied from the mainnet through the balance snapshot, is stored in this wallet. This wallet’s stake is not transferable, although it may be moved to and delegated from a Rewards wallet.

[^52]: **Double-spending** is a potential flaw in a digital cash scheme in which the same single digital token can be spent more than once. Unlike physical cash, a digital token consists of a digital file that can be duplicated or falsified. As with counterfeit money, such double-spending leads to inflation by creating a new amount of copied currency that did not previously exist. This devalues the currency relative to other monetary units or goods and diminishes user trust as well as the circulation and retention of the currency. Fundamental cryptographic techniques to prevent double-spending, while preserving anonymity in a transaction, are blind signatures and, particularly in offline systems, secret splitting.
