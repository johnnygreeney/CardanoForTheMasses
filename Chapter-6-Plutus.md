# Chapter 6: Plutus

There are a lot of moving parts in terms of a dApps architecture. We won’t be teaching you ‘how to code’ in the next few chapters, but you should get a good feel for the different languages, tools and services available. The various playgrounds and interactive programming tutorials arguably offer a more intuitive experience when you decide to code your first program. If blockchain is a minefield of jargon, then programming is just another patch you must traverse. Lets quickly run through some of the terms and phrases you will encounter. 

The **expressiveness** of a programming language is how easy it is to represent and communicate your ideas in a language. Kind of like the size of the vocabulary you have at your disposal.

**Imperative programming** is where we provide the computer with step-by-step instructions on HOW to execute a task. **Declarative programming** involves specifying WHAT result we're expecting from our code, without explicitly specifying step-by-step instructions.

**Functional programming** is a form of declarative programming that uses expressions and functions without mutating state and data. Although these restrictions can mean a less expressive syntax, functional programming places a focus on writing clear, understandable code that is less buggy.

A **compiler** translates code from a high-level language (eg. Python or JavaScript) into **machine code** before a program runs it. Whereas an **interpreter** may sound similar, except it translates the code written in a high-level language into machine code line-by-line as the code runs.

While compilers and interpreters convert high-level language into machine language, **assemblers** convert low-level language, or assembly language code, into machine language

**Machine language** is the binary digits, or 0s and 1s, that a particular computer can execute directly. Machine language is translated into **assembly language**, which is in hexadecimal form for human consumption.  

A **toolchain** set of software utilities used in programming, ie. the tools used to translate source code into a machine language code are the compiler, assembler, linker and debugger. 

When you hear somebody say ‘​​X is a first class citizen on Cardano’ …well in programming, being a first-class citizen usually means some entity which supports all the operations available to other entities. There is a subtle distinction from a ‘higher-order function’ which operates on other functions.

**LSP**, or Language Server Protocol is a term you may encounter… just think of it as an open protocol used between code editors. LSPs provide ‘language intelligence tools’ that make a developer’s life easier such as highlighted syntax, friendly error messages, auto-code completion which is kind of like predictive text on your phone.
