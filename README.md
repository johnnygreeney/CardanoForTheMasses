# Cardano for the M₳sses

## Book checklist— 
- rules there to be broken so guidelines…
- keep it simple, don’t use 'sesquicentennial' when you can just say 'hard'.
- 'Measure twice cut once'. Loose target of 10 chapters by 30 pages. If 2 pages are dedicated to important topic like 'Midnight' then don’t submit 3 pages on your project.
- Write for audience, eg. Pete hornan explain Sancho.network like you are talking to your daughters, explain it like your talking to Adam Dean if you are writing for the more technical book 'Mastering Cardano'. 

## To do
- add style guide references and ‘… tone is fact based, if grey area or contentious it’s omitted. Overall not opinionated or dramatic …after reading, reader explores and make up own mind… book is for newbies if around since beginning may not learn much from this book. Ultimately should be spring board into mastering c tech ref book…
- low stakes way of stress testing gov tools to choose a cover, etc…
- model for bootstrapping.... for now sales = giveaways… explain ‘author copies’ p&p… known knowns known unknowns… 
- Audio - abridged version + quotes mp4 audacity
- add guidelines for 'kdp', kindle, paperback, audible,
