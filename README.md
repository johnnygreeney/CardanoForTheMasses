# Cardano for the M₳sses

## Changes for new 'Chang' edition  
- _“I didn't have time to write a short letter, so I wrote a long one instead.”_  
The book should as concise as possible. Earlier editions were too long. Eg. I'm considering chopping anything too technical like programming language deep dives, might trim 'Plutus' and 'Marlowe' into one chapter outlining programming options with Aiken and others.
- Keep it short as possible, can a paragraph just be sentence? Do you need long sentences when a shorter simple one will do? Don’t say 'sesquipedalian' when you can just say 'long'.
- 'Measure twice cut once'. Loose target of 10 chapters of roughly equal length 15-25 google doc pages. Does your contribution fit into structure and tone of the rest of the book? If 2 pages are dedicated to important topic like 'Midnight' then don’t submit 3 pages on your project.
- Write for intended audience, ie. Someone who just heard of Cardano. Most reviewers/contributors are inside the Cardano bubble and often assume people know what 'byron reboot' was, or what a datum or redeemer is... 

## To do
- Add style guide references and ‘… tone is fact based, if grey area or contentious it’s omitted. Overall not opinionated or dramatic …after reading, reader explores and make up own mind… bUltimately should be spring board into 'Mastering Cardano' book which will be more technical. 
- May be a low stakes way of stress testing gov tools to choose a cover, etc…
- Model for bootstrapping....Model was always to be self-sustaining with no Catalyst funding, etc. I've given 100S of books away at conferences and meetups since Aug 2022. For now more sales = more giveaways... Amzn ‘author copies’ p&p allow slightly discounted distribution to events/meetups.
- Have had requests for Audio book - abridged version + quotes mp4 edited with audacity
- add guidelines for 'kdp', kindle, paperback, audible,

## To do
- add style guide
