# Cardano for the M₳sses

## Changes for new 'Chang' edition  
- _“I didn't have time to write a short letter, so I wrote a long one instead.”_  
The book should as concise as possible. Earlier editions were too long. Many sections have been cut to make it more concise and readable.
- Keep it short as possible, can a paragraph just be sentence? Do you need long sentences when a shorter simple one will do? Don’t say 'sesquipedalian' when you can just say 'long'.
- 'Measure twice cut once'. Target of 10 chapters of roughly equal length 15-25 google doc pages. Does your contribution fit into structure and tone of the rest of the book? 
- Write for intended audience, ie. Someone who just heard of Cardano. Most reviewers/contributors are inside the Cardano bubble and often assume people know what 'byron reboot' was, or what a datum or redeemer is... 

## To do
- Add style guide references and ‘… tone is fact based, if grey area or contentious it’s omitted. Overall not opinionated or dramatic …after reading, reader explores and make up own mind… but ultimately should be spring board into 'Mastering Cardano' book which will be more technical. 
- May be a low stakes way of stress testing gov tools to choose a cover, etc…
- Model for bootstrapping....Model was always to be self-sustaining with no Catalyst funding, etc. I've given hundreds of books away at conferences and meetups since Aug 2022. For now more sales equals more giveaways... Amzn ‘author copies’ p&p allow slightly discounted distribution to events/meetups.
- Based on requests, also working on Audio book - abridged version + quotes mp4 edited with audacity
- Guidelines for KDP, Kindle Direct Publishing[^1] are useful rules for all publishing platforms. Would be nice to get it out on more platforms like book.io, etc
