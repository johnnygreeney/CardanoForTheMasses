# Cardano for the M₳sses

The 4rd edition[^1], was published Jan 2025 under an open-source licence. 

## Guidelines for contributors  
>_'I didn't have time to write a short letter, so I wrote a long one instead'_  
- Keep it short as possible, without leaving important stuff out.  
- Everything is done in 'markdown' files, see here[^2] for a cheatsheet
- 'Measure twice cut once'. Target of 11 chapters of roughly equal length 15-25 google doc pages.  
-  Intended audience, ie. Someone who just heard of Cardano. This book should be the less technical 'story of Cardano' that preps readers for more technical 'Mastering Cardano' book coming soon.

## To do
- Add style guide 
- improve/replace graphics
- Guidelines for KDP, Kindle Direct Publishing[^3] are useful rules for all publishing platforms. 

## Translations of earlier editions

There has already been progress made on a **Spanish** translation by Humberto Rojas Serrano and Joe San.

A **Japanese** translation[^4], funded by Catalyst, is already complete and available.[^5]  

A **Vietnamese** translation is now complete. Led by Hoang Phuong Linh, with team from - http://Cardano.Vn, the project received Catalyst funding in Fund11[^6]. You can download PDF of the translation[^7], listen to the audiobook online.[^8]

A **Finnish** translation, by Kai Ahokangas, is in progress.

If you are interested in translating this book, please get in touch: john@cardanobook.com. The plan is to keep it simple and manage translations in subfolders [here](/translations). Translators can follow whatever format they wish, however, I recommened following same 'markdown' format as this main repo.
