## H2

Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
⋅⋅* Unordered sub-list. 
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
⋅⋅1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses

[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

[I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[I'm a relative reference to a repository file](../blob/master/LICENSE)

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links. 
http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com> and sometimes 
example.com (but not on Github, for example).

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

[arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]: https://www.mozilla.org
[1]: http://slashdot.org
[link text itself]: http://www.reddit.com

Here's our logo (hover to see the title text):

Here is a simple footnote.

A footnote can also have multiple lines[^2].  

You can also use words, to fit your writing style more closely[^note].

 My reference.
[^2]: Every new line should be prefixed with 2 spaces.  
  This allows you to have a footnote with multiple lines.
[^note]:
    Named footnotes will still render with numbers instead of the text but allow easier identification and linking.  
    This footnote also has been made with a different syntax using 4 spaces for new lines.

## Origins of blockchain and cryptocurrencies

Anyone who doubts the adage ‘the truth is stranger than fiction’ should look at the history of money.[^1] From the round stones on Yap island, to the Irish ‘paying through the nose’ to the Danes, to the peace and prosperity of the Belle Époque era, to the adoption and abandonment of the gold standard…cryptocurrencies, and the blockchains  they run on, are just the latest twist in a long and colorful story.

To understand a third generation blockchain such as Cardano, we must first review its predecessors. The first generation is Bitcoin, whose goal was to create decentralized money. Could there be a scarce, tradable token that lives on some sort of decentralized blockchain maintained by people all around the world?

This wasn’t a new pursuit. Bitcoin happened to be the breakthrough, but it was built on previous attempts. The idea of Bitcoin started in the 1980s, with a lot of ideas coming from the ‘cypherpunk’ movement. Ecash preceded DigiCash with pioneering work from Hal Finney and David Chaum. During the 1990s and into the early 2000s, Nick Szabo proposed the ‘bitgold’ system. There were other contributing factors like the technological advances of the Arm chip powering smaller devices, making processing possible.

In 2008, Bitcoin was just a pipe dream in the form of a white paper. Satoshi Nakamoto is the pseudonym for whomever it was who wrote this paper. The Bitcoin founder has remained anonymous, even after their email account was compromised and emails publicly shared. Since the beginning, Bitcoin has been shrouded in mystery. It is an experiment born out of discontent with the way things are, and idealism for how things should be. On January 3, 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto mined the first block – the genesis block – for Bitcoin. These 100,000 lines of mediocre C++ code attracted a lot of brilliant minds. 

From early supporters such as Hal Finney to Martti Malmi, many others flocked over the years as Bitcoin grew from a few crypto anarchists on a mailing list, to a global movement. All this despite no marketing budget, with a logo provided by a forum user with the name Bitboy. Bitcoin has since proven its resilience. It has been declared dead countless times and endured many crashes. It has lost many of its early contributors. Developers such as Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen fell out and left. Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous founder, vanished. Despite these obstacles and setbacks, the dream has persisted.

Within a few years, Bitcoin accrued thousands of users who could send and receive value without a trusted third party, or intermediary. The price of bitcoin went from less than a penny to $1 in 2011, to $1,000 in 2013, $17,000 in 2018 and a peak of $67,000 in 2021. Amid this, there were the crashes, such as the ‘crypto winter’ of 2017, when the bitcoin price fell from about $20,000 to $6,000 within weeks. There was a similar crash in early 2022, with two-thirds of the price again being lost.

The idealism of Bitcoin is about creating better money, or ‘sound money in a digital age’ as described by the economist Saifedean Ammous in The Bitcoin Standard. Bitcoin appeared after the 2008 financial meltdown, the worst global financial crisis since the Great Depression. Many people were starting to go back to first principles, questioning whether central banks could be trusted to create ‘sound money’? Can other people create better money? Does the world really need banks to act as middlemen? Can’t I just be my own bank? Questions like these, along with a mistrust of institutions, were the seeds from which Bitcoin grew.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote.
