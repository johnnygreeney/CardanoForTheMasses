## Extended UTXO 

Blockchain networks are complicated data structures. Transactions traverse the chain on a regular basis, leaving digital fingerprints[^01] that must be carefully tracked and managed to maintain the underlying ledger’s integrity and trustworthiness. In the blockchain world, there are two main types of accounting ledgers: UTXO-based blockchains (like Bitcoin) and Account/Balance chains (Ethereum, and others).

The accounting models of these two models vary in many ways. The Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) model is used by Bitcoin, Cardano, Zcash, Ergo, Avalanche and others while the Account/Balance model is used by Ethereum, Polkdot, Algorand, etc.

Cardano aimed to create an Extended UTXO (eUTXO) accounting model by combining Bitcoin’s UTXO model with Ethereum’s capacity to handle smart contracts. The adoption of eUTXO makes it easier to integrate smart contracts into the Cardano network.

**How does the accounting model work?**
